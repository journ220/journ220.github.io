Or, you might even be interested in becoming a newsroom technologist yourself.</p><p>How you present the work, the layout, page hierarchy and interactive elements are at their core critical editorial conversations that require the same thoughtfulness and discussion as any other journalism endeavor.

Let us know if you’re rushing from a faraway class and will regularly need a few extra minutes. If you’re going to be late, message both Yoli and Soo in the J-school Slack. One of us will try to monitor the Slack near the beginning of class. Be the least disruptive as you can when you arrive to not disturb the lecture and other students.</p><p>If you’re sick or have a family emergency, email us anytime before lecture to let us know. (If it’s really an emergency, email when you get the chance — you don’t have to get in touch from the back of an ambulance!)</p><p>We will make course materials available on this website and can help you to a reasonable extent. However, it is ultimately your responsibility to catch up with the class.</p><p><strong>What should you do if you’re feeling sick?</strong></p><p>No matter how OK you feel, don’t come to class if you think you’re contagious (with a cold, flu, strep, coronavirus, etc). Lectures are recorded; however, there is a risk that the wifi is choppy, the recording messes up, or some other problem. Again, it’s ultimately your responsibility to catch up with the class. Talk to us about how.</p><h3 id="assignment-deadlines">Assignment deadlines</h3><p>All assignments must be submitted on time in bCourses. There will be no exceptions made for late assignments except for medical reasons and family emergencies. An assignment will be dropped a full letter grade for every 24 hours that pass after the deadline, starting the minute after the deadline (e.g. an assignment with no mistakes will be graded as 90% one minute after deadline, 80% one minute and 24 hours after deadline, and so on).</p><h3 id="participation-in-class">Participation in class</h3><ul><li><p>You’re expected to adhere to the <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1ZsFEfFYUUi_3dBivFXGO9aKlc-4iiklv/view" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Guidelines for Dialogue &amp; Community Expectations</a>.</p></li><li><p>Set your phone to silent or Do Not Disturb mode before class begins.

As a result, it is up to every student to maintain this high standard by ensuring that all academic work reflects their own ideas or properly attributes the ideas to the original sources. These are some basic expectations of students with regards to academic integrity:</p><ul><li>Any work submitted should be your own individual thoughts, and should not have been submitted for credit in another course unless you have prior written permission to re-use it in this course from this instructor.</li><li>All assignments must use “proper attribution,” meaning that you have identified the original source of words or ideas that you reproduce or use in your assignment. This includes drafts and homework assignments.</li><li>If you’re unclear about expectations around attribution and plagiarism, ask us.</li></ul><p><strong>What does proper attribution mean for code when Googling and using <a href="stackoverflow.com">stackoverflow.com</a> are the norm?</strong></p><p>I’m so glad you asked. If you were stuck and found code online to help you, link to the resource in your documentation, either in the code comments or in a markdown block for a notebook. Make sure you format or rewrite the code in the preferred style of your programming language (single or double quotes, snake_case or camelCase, and so on).</p><h2 id="disabled-students%E2%80%99-program">Disabled Students’ Program</h2><p>UC Berkeley is committed to creating a learning environment that meets the needs of its diverse student body including students with disabilities. If you anticipate or experience any barriers to learning in this course, please feel welcome to discuss your concerns with us.</p><p>If you have a disability, or think you may have a disability, you can work with the Disabled Students’ Program (DSP) to request an official accommodation. DSP is the campus office responsible for authorizing disability-related academic accommodations, in cooperation with the students themselves and their instructors. You can find more information about DSP, including contact information and the application process here: <a href="https://dsp.berkeley.edu" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">https://dsp.berkeley.edu</a>. If you have already been approved for accommodations through DSP, please meet with us so we can develop an implementation plan together.</p><p>Students who need academic accommodations or have questions about their accommodations should contact DSP, located at 260 César Chávez Student Center.
